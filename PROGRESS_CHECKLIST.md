# Cloth Web Demo – Progress Checklist (Legacy)

This document captured the original cloth demo checklist.  
The canonical, up-to-date checklist for all work (cloth, engine, Newton) now lives in `ROADMAP.md`.

Status:

- All implementation tasks from this file have been completed and are reflected in **Milestone M0 – Cloth Demo Baseline** in `ROADMAP.md`.
- The remaining open items (manual QA passes, demo script/visuals) have been moved into `ROADMAP.md` under:
  - M0 (open QA / narrative tasks)
  - TEST_PLAN.md remains the narrative QA plan.

Going forward:

- Update progress and add new tasks in `ROADMAP.md` only.
- Treat this file as historical context for how the initial cloth demo was delivered.
